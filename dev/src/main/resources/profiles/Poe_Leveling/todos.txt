- Introduction
 Hey this is a small Todo list I created for the start of the next season.
 I only did develop this program, the leveling guide is copied from two sources.
 These creators deserve all the recognition for this:
 <li style="margin-left: 2em">The quick leveling guide from <b>Atroz</b> found <a href="https://www.poe-vault.com/guides/quick-reference-leveling-guide-for-path-of-exile">here</a>.<br/>Most of the todos are directly copied from there</li>
 <li style="margin-left: 2em">Layout images for the Zones from the reddit user <b>_treB</b> found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sExA-AnTbroJ-HN2neZiij5G4X9u2ENlC7m_zf1tqP8/edit#heading=h.cuylvxdefwv0">here</a>.

The Layouts have the following structure
 
 <img src="/img/intro_layout.png">
 
 if you find any problems or some infrmation is outdated please let me know.
 I developed this program over the course of one weekend, so there are probably lots of bugs and edge cases that aren't treated yet.
 You can also modify the todo list yourself using the "Edit Todos" button in the control panel.
 By creating a new Todo list using the "+" Button an example list with instructions is automatically created.
 Enjoy und have a nice season start.
